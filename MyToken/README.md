# JTokens Smart Contract

This Solidity smart contract, `JTokens`, implements a basic ERC20 token named "Just My Tokens" (JMT). It provides functionalities for minting, transferring, and burning tokens.

## Overview

The contract inherits from the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation, providing standard ERC20 token functionalities. Additionally, it includes custom functions for minting, transferring tokens, and burning tokens.

## Features

- **ERC20 Standard**: Implements the ERC20 token standard, enabling compatibility with various wallets and decentralized applications (dApps).
- **Minting Tokens**: Allows the contract owner to mint new tokens and distribute them to specified addresses.
- **Transferring Tokens**: Facilitates the transfer of tokens between addresses, following the ERC20 transfer protocol.
- **Burning Tokens**: Permits token holders to burn (destroy) their own tokens, reducing the total token supply.

## Installation

To deploy and interact with this smart contract, you can follow these steps:

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository containing the smart contract code.
2. **Compile Contract**: Use a Solidity compiler (e.g., Remix, Hardhat, Truffle) to compile the `JTokens.sol` file.
3. **Deploy Contract**: Deploy the compiled contract to your preferred Ethereum-compatible blockchain network.
4. **Interact with Contract**: Utilize a wallet or smart contract interface (e.g., Remix, Etherscan) to interact with the deployed contract, minting, transferring, and burning tokens as needed.

## Usage

1. **Mint Tokens**: Call the `mint` function with the desired recipient address and token amount to mint new tokens.
2. **Transfer Tokens**: Use the `transferTokens` function to transfer tokens from one address to another.
3. **Burn Tokens**: Invoke the `burnTokens` function to burn a specified amount of tokens from your own balance.
